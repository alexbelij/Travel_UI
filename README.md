<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img src="assets/images/ReadmeScreen.png"  align="center" height="400" />

Our latest design is for an app that helps to discover interesting tourist spots. If you’ve ever wanted to enhance the travel industry (or you’re always eager to travel)


A few details:

* To prevent users from visiting separate category pages, we’ve decided to organize content using horizontal scrolling.

* Light-colored background is superb for content-driven interfaces. In this case, it definitely does the trick and helps the user focus primarily on breath-taking spots and views.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With
* [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI6d7wjfrb6QIVWJ3VCh20-QUzEAAYASAAEgJJuvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
#### STEP 1
To get started with Flutter, your dev environment must meet the following requirements

| Operating Systems        | Windows 7 SP1 or later (64-bit)           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Disk Space     | 400 MB (does not include disk space for IDE/tools) |
| Tool    | Windows PowerShell 5.0 or newer      |
| Tool | Git for Windows 2.x     |

You can choose either the first tool or second depending on how comfortable you are with either.

#### STEP 2

- Download an installation bundle [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/flutter_infra/releases/stable/windows/flutter_windows_v1.2.1-stable.zip) to get the latest stable release of the Flutter SDK
- Extract the zip file and place the contained flutter in the desired installation location for the Flutter SDK (eg. C:\src\flutter;  do not install Flutter in a directory like C:\Program Files\ that requires elevated privileges ).
- Locate the file flutter_console.bat inside the flutter directory. Start it by double-clicking.

Congratulations! You are now ready to run Flutter commands in the Flutter Console!

NOTE: Should you at anytime require an ugrade to a latest Flutter version? [Use this link](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/tools/sdk/upgrading)


#### STEP 3 (Optional)

If you wish to run Flutter commands in the regular Windows console, take these steps to add Flutter to the PATH environment variable:
- From the Start search bar, type ‘env’ and select Edit environment variables for your account
- Under User variables check if there is an entry called Path(If it exist append the full path to flutter\bin using ; as a separator from existing values else create a new user variable named Path with the full path to flutter\bin as its value)


#### STEP 4
If at any point you need to check your environment and see a report of the status of your Flutter installation, all you need is the command below.
```windows
 flutter doctor
 ```
 Here is a sample output:
 ```windows
[-] Android toolchain - develop for Android devices
    • Android SDK at D:\Android\sdk
    ✗ Android SDK is missing command line tools; download from https://goo.gl/XxQghQ
    • Try re-installing or updating your Android SDK,
      visit https://flutter.dev/setup/#android-setup for detailed instructions.
 ```
Ensure you check the output carefully for other software you may need to install or further tasks to perform (shown in bold text).


### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git https://github.com/mounir2KH/Travel_UI.git
```
2.In Android Studio
           * Open the IDE and select Start a new Flutter project.
           * Select Flutter Application as the project type. Then click Next.
           * Verify the Flutter SDK path specifies the SDK’s location (select Install SDK… if the text field is blank).
           * Enter a project name (for example, myapp). Then click Next.
           * Click Finish.
           * Wait for Android Studio to install the SDK and create the project.

    To run the app in android studio **run>run**
